{\color{titleColor} \section{Work Experience}}

\subsection{\textbf{Software Engineer - L4, Google \hfill June 2017-present}}
{\color{default} Google Maps data infrastructure, Geo-Feeds: developing 
  distributed pipelines to process third party (and internal) data into google 
  maps. Allows clients to access google maps infrastucture to match their data 
  to internal data, obtain statistics on the quality of their data, and splice
  their data before submitting to the map.}

\subsection{\textbf{Software Engineering intern, Google \hfill Summer 2016}}
{\color{default} Google Maps data infrastructure, Geo-Feeds.}

\subsection{\textbf{Summer Technology Analyst, Citi \hfill Summer 2015}} 
{\color{default} Worked on team developing a front office
  platform using Java and Spring. I added JSON support to the backend trade
  processing system so that JSON encoded trade information can be sent through
  an API call. I also made a stress test program for our backend using Gatling
  and Scala.}

\subsection{\textbf{Software Engineering Intern, Kongsberg ITS \hfill Summer 2014}}
{\color{default} Worked on a digital radio system: doing socket programming in
  \verb!C++! as well as GUI development in \verb!C#! for a military vehicle control system. I
  wrote testing software for the control system as well in \verb!C++! and \verb!C#! that
  communicated over a CAN bus.  }

{\color{default}BS Computer Science, BS Applied Mathematics and Statistics} \hfill \textbf{2016} \\ 
\textbf{GPA}: {\color{default} 3.59} 
\textbf{Awards}: {\color{default}Dean’s List, University Scholars program, Presidential Scholarship}


{\color{titleColor}\section{Projects/Open Source Contributions}}
\subsection{\textbf{Visual SLAM Robotics Implementation (course project)}}
{\color{default} Final project for graduate Computer Vision course on a team of two. We
implemented a version of the SLAM algorithm for a real robot based off the
paper: \href{
  ''http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~cmei/articles/AConstantTimeEfficientStereoSLAMSystem_rss_09.pdf''}{A
  Constant Time Stereo Slam} which details an efficient method to localize and
map a robot's environment through live a video feed using \verb!C++! and OpenCV (Code
located on github).}
\subsection{\textbf{Emacs-Eclim (open source project)}}
{\color{default} Contributed to the open source project “Emacs-Eclim”
  which provides an interface for emacs to use Eclim, a backend code completion
  and project manager backend for text editors, using Eclipse. I helped add
  Scala completion and error checking to the Emacs Eclim project. }
\subsection{\textbf{Friend Finder App (Android app)}} 
{\color{default} Competed at Mhacks (2013) where we built an android app that
  would point to a fellow android who had the same app so that you can find your
  friends. I helped code the formulas to determine the angles and implemented a
  page with your locations on a map using Google APIs.}
